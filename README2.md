Final reflections on class

I have thoroughly enjoyed this class because it has allowed me to create art in a way that is very far from being intentional. Every single piece of mine has resulted in something conceptually similar, but very aesthetically different to what I initially intended. I think this is a sign that I have not yet mastered coding, but the class has forced me to be content with modifying an original concept as the development of the piece goes on. For this reason, I am so excited to continue my work and ideas that I began in Interactive Graphics next semester in the p5.js class called Physical Computing. I am looking forward to producing pieces that interact with the material world beyond the computer interface. 

One of the most interesting things that producing and researching digital art has taught me is that the nature of art is not at all about genius, but it is more like a technique that one has to master over time. The art projects I have coded have truly underlined this technical aspect of art since it is only through re-writing and debugging the code of each piece that allows for anything to appear on the screen. If the program is written wrong, it probably won't function and therefore it requires - unlike a painting - a continual reworking of the initial framework.
